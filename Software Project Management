---------
-Understand the efficient techniques of 

Definition of terms
--------------------
-differenciate between -data and information   - 
                       -Knowledge and intelligence.- retained information while intelligence is knowledge or rather expert kno
 -process - is a kind of interelated any action or activities performed to achieve a set of product service results
 -project -is a defined or rather plan undertaked or related activities to reach an objective that has a beginning and end 
         - a temporary endeveavior undertaken to create a unique product on services.
         
 characteristic of computer project 
 ---------------------------------------
     - plan 
     -unique
      -Non routine
    - it requires planning 
     -Predefined timeline, that is a start and end.
    
-project involves different  specialist
-project involves  several phases.


1)what is the difference between software project  and construction project/ other projects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-visibility - S/w project is very hard to see the progress unlike the construction project.
-protype - 
-complexity - s/w project errors/bugs can be  solve while for construction, you demolish to solve the error.
- In Constraction site you dont need a chart to see progress, It takes shapes right infront of you, 
  while in software office it takes a little time to get used to the fact that everyone spend their day in 
  front of a screen.
  -A construction project is all about the deployment of scarce and valuable resources such are
   materials, plant and labor unlike the software developement that requires few talented people and some 
   reasonable comfortable seats.
   -Construction is a waterfall process, first you dig a hole, then you build the fundation. Each
   step is necessary to cascade down to the next step on the next project program unlike the software
    which  is largely modular, you can build the parts or features separately and glue them together.

2)Discuss 9 knowledge areas of pmiBok/pmBok
------------------------------------------------
-p - project
-m - management
-B - book
-o - of
-k - knowledge
-
-1. Project Integration management - processes and activities needed to identify, define, combine,
                                     unify and coordinate different  process and activities with project  management project group.

-2.Project scope management - It  contains milestones related to project that can help the 
                               client to know what is expected from them.
                            - it also define the following five sub-process:
                                        1.collection requirement
                                        2.Define scope
                                        3.create work breakdown structure
                                        4.verify  scope
                                        5.control scope 
3. Project Time management - 
                             It contains some sub-processes associates that makes project complete in time.
                             And they includes:
                                             Define activites
                                             sequence activities
                                             estimate the resource requiremed
                                             estimate the time required
                                             control shedule
4.Project cost management - through this one can be able to complete project in time with the exact estimate budget.
                            It consist of some sub-process that make it come to success and they include:
                             -Estimate cost
                             -Determine budget
                             -control costs
5.Project Quality Management - It align with the user requirement 
6.Project Human resource management - It the set of processes and activities involved in organizing, leading
                                      and  managing project teams.
                                     -It involve the sub-process such as:
                                            -Developing a human resource plan
                                            -Hire the project team
                                            -Develop a project team
                                            -Manage project team
7.Project communication management - poor project communication can wreck havoc on your project progress.
                                    -Should be effective and regularly to enhance collaboration and communication 
                                    among the team members.
8.Project Risk Management - It is the important factor in completin  projects successfully.
                            It plays an important role by preventing project from failure.
9.Project procurement management - it covers all aspects related to purchases and acquiring  of products and 
                                   services needed  to complete project effectively.

3)Diffenciate  between   process groups and SDLC
------------------------------------------------
-process group  are not project phases,it  focus on the project management phases while SDLC focus
 on the software engineering phasees processes, tools and techniques for building and/ implementing the
 IT solutions.

N/B Group discussion AND PRESENTATION(NEXTWEEK)
===============================================
4)with an aid/m of a diagram Discuss the  five process group and their deliverables(the reports)(five marks)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Initiating phase - triggers the planning process group.
                  
-Planning phase -  triggers the execution process group.
-Execution - is the phase where the most ofthe project work is delivered.
-Monitoring and controlling - is the only project management process group that iteract with other four.
                             It is in this phase where project team checks whether everything is 
                             going as planned
-Closing - helps to close the project after all objective are met
5)Discuss the 9 knowledge areas as defined in pmbok  by (project mgt institute/pmi)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Project integration management - includes such fundamental plans as developing a  project charter 
                                   charter that id created during the initiation phase.
                                 - Another aspect of this area is the project management plan
                                   which is developed as a project roadmap for the project to reach
                                   as successful end.
                                   
-Project scope management - This includes  plan scope management, which is part of the project management plan.
                          
-Project Time managememt - the project is divided into task, which are scheduled with start dates and deadline
                           as well as budget for  each task.
                          
-Project cost management -  this area involves the project budget, which means having good estimating tools to 
                            to make sure that the funds covers the entent of the project and are being monitored 
                            reglarly to keep stakeholders or sponsor informed.
                            
-project Quality management - 
-project human resource management - human resource management plan will identify their  roles and 
                                     roles and their   requirement  for those positions, as well as how they
                                      fit in the overall project stucture.
                                      
-projet  communication management - 
-project  risk management -  will identify how the risk wll be itemized, categories and prioritized.

6)Differentciate btw s/w project  mgt and other mgt
--------------------------------------------------------
-

7)differenciate btw  PERT chart , GANT chart
----------------------------------------
-Gantt chart is a bar chart that lays out project tasks and timelines linearly while PERT is
 network diagram that displays all the project tasks in separate boxies and connect them with arrows
  to clearly clear show task dependencies.
-PERT  can define all task and activites required for project, the develop a realistic timeframe for project competion.
while Cantt is used to check how long each task is exprected to take , also great for visualizing
the order of specific tasks as well as the teams and individuals responsible for each task.

8)-Discuss  the 4 constraints of a project / sw project (time, scope, quality)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Time constraint - refers to the project's shedule for completion, including the deadline 
                  for each phase.
                  
-Scope constaint - the scope of a project defines its specific goals, deliverables, features and 
                  functions.
-Cost constraint - comprises all of the financial resources needed to complete the project on time

9)what is PMBOK
---------------
-Stands for Project managemen Body of Knowledge.
-Is is the entire collection of processes, best practices, terminologies and guideline that are accepted as standard within
 the project management industry.
10)Differenciate between mgt, project management and software project management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-



Project life cycle management 
-----------------------------------
-Process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from inceptio, through  engineering design and disposal of a
 manufactured products.
- It has the following phases:
                         ideal generation
                         idea screen 
                         business analysis
                         product developement
                         Test marketing
                         commercialization
                         Evaluate and refine
 -Its main focus is:
              product features and functionalities.

Project management
------------------------
-Temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.
-Application of knowledge  skills, tools,  and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirement.
