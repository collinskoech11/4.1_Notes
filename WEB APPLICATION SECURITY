-what is risk in computer security? - anything that can can cause damage to confidentiality, availability and intergrity of data and systems.
                                    - they include misconfigured software, unpatches operating system, unsafe computer habits.
-privileges -
-encryption - converting plain text to cipher text.
-cipher - plain text that has undergone the cryptographic algorithms, to be much longer than the actual word or being shorter than the word.
-decryption – converting the cipher text to plain text.( algorithm and key)
-vulnerability -  loop hole in a system that can be exploited.                                                     CHAPTER ONE                                                       20/01/2021/LESSON 2

Type of cryptography
-Secret key(symmetric)(skc) -uses one key for encryption and decryption.( Ruleset)
-Public key(Asymmetric)(pkc ) - use one key for encryption and another for decryption.
-Hash function - use mathematical transformation to irreversible encrypt information.(uses the hash function for encryption and decryption)
-


SKC algorithm
1-Data encryption standard
         -Triple -DESX
         -DESX
-DES - employ 56bit key that operate on  64bit block.
2-Advanced encryption standard 
      -uses a variable block length.
3 - 

PKC
-uses two keys that are mathematically related.
-How can the second party knows that the message is from the first party?
 if the second party successfully decrypt message send  by the first party using their public key.

         Diffie-hellman 
         ----------------
         -Introduced the concept of public key cryptography.
         -first published public-key  crypto algorithm.
         -practical method for pubic exchange of a secret key.
         -used in a number of commmercial products.
         -It allowed two paties to generate a secret key.
         -they need to exchange some information over an unsecure communication channel  
         to perform the calculation.
         -Can also be used to allow key sharing amongst multiple users.
                                        
                                        
                         Diffie-Hellman steps
                         -----------------------
        1. A & B share a large number q
        2. they choose a number  A (A is primitive to q)
           primitive - relating to or denoting.
        3.Each choose private keys X
                X
        4. Each user calculate their public key, y
        alice  y=AxA mode q
        Bob= yB = AXB mode q
       .The parties share the public keys
       .Each use computes the session keys
           Alice  KA = YBXA mod q
           Boby  KB = YAXB  mod q
           
   -primitive - element in a group in a whose power exhaust the entire group        
                                        
          application of the three cryptographic  techniques for secure communication
          ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -hybrid cryptographic sheme is the compinations of all of these functions to form s cecure transmission comprising
  digital signature and digital environment.
 -Digital environment - is the compination of the message and all encrypted session key.
                      
                      
            why the three encryption techniques
