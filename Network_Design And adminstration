           -interface fastethernate 0/0
           -Promote with # indicates you are in interface configuration mode.
           -to show all possible commands or option parameters   insert ?.

----------------------------------
access-expression - Build a bridge boolean access expression 
arp - set arp type (arpa, probe snap)
backup - modify  backup parameters.
ip  - interface internet protocol config command

Revision Notes From CISCO
-------------------------
Hub and Switch
---------------
-Both act as centrol point to which all the computers are connected.
 
OSI(open system interconnection)
-------------------------------------
-Has seven layers:
                  Application         away
                  presentation        pizza
                  session             sausage
                  Transport           throw
                  Network             not
                  Data link           do
                  Physical            please

Definition of terms
----------------------
-throughput - rate at which data is traversing link.
            -measurement of all data though /flowing through a link.
-Goodput - rate at which useful data traverses a link.
         - focuses on useful data only.
-Host/end device - origin or end devices.
-Intermediary  devices - propag
             

Course outline  15/01/2021
----------------------------
-Why design - 
-why administration-  being in

What is  network system and administration?
---------------------------------------
-network system addministration is a branch of enginerrin that concern the operational management  of human and computer system.
 this enginerring is unusual because enginering concept have specific technology solution.
-A system adnminstrator work for users so that they can use a system to produce work. therefore a system adminstrator should focus 
 not on the few selfish means but all community(global).
-Once a computing device is attach in the internet, we have to consider the consequences of being directly connected to all other computing device in the world.
