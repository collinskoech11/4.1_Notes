Modes on A router
-------------------
1. user mode -  use  see some statistical information.
2.privilege mode - can be entered by enable command.
3.global configuration mode - facilitate any possible subsequence 
                           configuration mode and make global changes.
                           -can be intered with configure terminal command or config t 
                           -hostname nameOftheHost
                           -exit
                           -clock set ?
                           -banner motd? - configures security policy.
                                         banner motd # ** AUTHORIZED USERS ONLY** #
                           -enable secret command
4. To make a change to the fasterethernet interface 0/0 then you have  to enter interface 
   configuration mode.
           -interface fastethernate 0/0
           -Promote with # indicates you are in interface configuration mode.
           -to show all possible commands or option parameters   insert ?.
    
interface configuration command 
----------------------------------
access-expression - Build a bridge boolean access expression 
arp - set arp type (arpa, probe snap)
backup - modify  backup parameters.
ip  - interface internet protocol config command

Hub and Switch
---------------
-Both act as centrol point to which all the computers are connected.

  Network protocol  and communication overview
  -----------------------------------------------
  -models
  -standards that makes network work
  -How communication occur over network.
  
  
  Elements in communications
  --------------------------
  -message source(sender)
  -destination (receiver)
  -channel(media) - provides pathway over which the message travels.
  
  
  Protocol
  --------------
  -Rules that govern communication 
 
 
 What a protocol must account
 -------------------------------------
 -An identified sender and receiver
 -Common language and grammer.
 -Speed and timing of delivery.
 -confirmation or acknowledgement requirement.
  
  
 -Message encoding - first step of sending message.
                   -process of converting information into another acceptable form
                    for transmission.
 -Decoding - Reversed encoding in order to intercept the information.
 -Encapsulation - placing one message format(letter) inside another message format envelop.
 
 
 Rules of  engagement for message timing
 ----------------------------------------
 -access method
 -flow control
 -Response timeout
 
- Access method - determine when someone is able to send a message.
-Flow control - used to negotiate correct timing for successful correct timing for successful communication.
-Response Timeout - rules that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a responses timeout occur.


Message delivery options
----------------------
-Unicast - is one -to - one delivery option
         - one/single destination for the message
-Multicast - one to many delivery option.
           - a delivery of the same message to a  group of host destination simultanously.
-Broadcast - one to all message delivery option.



Rules that Govern communication
-----------------------------------
-Protocol suite - A group of inter-related protocol necessary to perform a communication.
                - implemented by hosts and networking devices in software.
                
common Networking protocols
-----------------------------
-Hypertext transfer protocol(HTTP)
-Transmission control protocol (TCP)
-Internet protocol (IP
 
 
-IP refers to both ipv4 and ipv6 


Interaction of protocols
-----------------------------
layer name                       protocol stack
------------------------------------------------------
Application                      HTTP
------------------------------------------------------
Transport                        TCP
------------------------------------------------------
Internet                        IP
------------------------------------------------------
Network access                  Ethernet
------------------------------------------------------



              HTTP
              -----
-An application protocol.
-Governs the way the way web servers and web client interact.
-Defines the content and formatting  of the requests and responses.
-Implemented by both web server and web client software.


            TCP
            -----
-Transport protocol.
-Devides HTTP.message into segment.
-The segment are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                       
                                 
-service.
-Topology - design of the network.
          - Classified into:
                        physical
                        logical
           -types:
                Bus
                ring
                mesh
                
                
   Characteristics of a good network
   -----------------------------------
 -Scalability
 -quality of service
 -secuirity
 -Tolerance
 
 TCPIP model
 --------------
 -It has the following layers:
                 -Application
                 -Transport
                 -Internate
                 -Network
 
 
 
             

Course outline  15/01/2021
----------------------------
-Why design -
-what is Design in networking - planning  of the implementation of a computer network insfrustructure.
                               Performed by:
                                           Network designers
                                           Engineers
                                           IT administrators
-What is adminstration - Responsibility for keeping an organization's computer network up-to-
                         date and operating intended.
-why administration-  being in

What is  network system and administration?
---------------------------------------
-network system addministration is a branch of engineering that concern the operational management  of human and computer system.
 this engineering is unusual because engineering concept have specific technology solution.
-A system adminstrator work for users so that they can use a system to produce work. therefore a system adminstrator should focus 
 not on the few selfish means but all community(global).
-Once a computing device is attach in the internet, we have to consider the consequences of being directly connected to all other computing device in the world.
