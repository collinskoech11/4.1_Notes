 What AI can do
 --------------------
 -Taging a face in a facebook photo.
 -AI that is  running behind the scenes and identifying faces 
 -Automous cars running on roads detect object in real time to steer the car.
 -Object detection technic in real time helps to learn the real-time traffic situation and 
 follow the bes path(Google direction)
 -Google translator, helps in communications.
 
 -The advantange of AI is that it can it can perform extremely complex
 jobs with a great accuracy and speed.
 -For example the google direction suggest the fastest path to our destination that time instance.
 -It can judge the traffic situation in every possible path to give
  you a travel time estimate for each such path.
 -Alot of AI and machine learning techniques are in-use under the hoods of  google
 direction so that it can cover the entire globe.
 
 Statistical techniques that are used  for developing AI applications
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Regression
 -Classification
 -Clustering
 -Probabilities Theories
 -Decision trees
 -Satistical techniques  is used to develop AI with limited data.
 -Advanced methods such as the deep lerning can solve the many complex problems.
 
      What is machine learning
      --------------------------
 -Machine learing  is like an act of using the statistical optimazation techniques to  find out the equation 
 for the best curve.
 -It uses the optimazation technique to find the solution to problem.
       
       Categories of machine learning
       --------------------------------
 -Supervised learning (sl)
 -Unsupervised learning( ul)
 -Reinforcement leaning(rl)
 -Deep learning(dl)
 -Deep reinforcement learning (drl)
 
 
 ->ul - machine is made to learn on its own without any supervision.
 ->sl - ie the case of  housing price prediction.
 ->dl - human brain is simulated  in the artificial neural network(ANN) created in binary computers.
 -Machine learn on its own using the high computing power and huge memory resources that are available today.

 Supervised learning
 -----------------------
 -Analogous to training a child to walk.
 
 Regression
 -------------
 -Similar to supervised learning accept  that you give a concrete known examples to the
  computer.
  
  Classification 
  ---------------
  -You classify objects of similar nature into a single groups.
  
  Unsupervised learning
  ---------------------
  -Do not  specify a target variable to the machine, rather we ask machine what it can tell about a
  specific object.
  -To reach at this point the is a large number  of dataset  points that  the machine would require to 
  deduce .
  -For the case of supervised a machine need to be trained with even few thousands of data points.
  -For the cause of unsupervised learning, the number of data point that is reasonable 
   accepted for learning start in a few millions.
   -data idealy requires  curating.
   -Data Curating - is the organisation and integration  of data collection from various source.
                  - It involve annotation, publication and presentation of data such that the value of the data is maintained over time.
                    and data remains available  for reuse and preservation.
                    
 Reinforcement learning 
 ----------------------
 -Initially developed for machine to play Games.
 -The machine is given an algorithm  to analyze all possible moves at each  stage of the game.
 -The machine can select one of the move at random.
 -If the move is right,  the machine is rewarded, otherwise it may be penalized.
 -Slowly the machine started differenciating between right and wrong moves.
 -After a several iteration it started it would learn to solve the game puzzle with a better accuracy.
 -The accuracy of winning the game would improve as  the machine plays more and more games.
 
 
 How does the supervised learning different from the  reinforcement learning 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Reinforcement learning need not supply the labelled input/output pairs.
  their focus is on finding the  the balance  betweeen exploring new solution verse exploiting the
  learned  solution.
  
  
  
  DEEP LEARNING
  ---------------------
  -A model based on Artificial Neural  Network(ANN),  more specifically,
   convolution  neueal networks(CNN),.

                                 Recurrent neural network
                                 convolution neural network.
  -This networks have been successfully applied in  solving the problems of:

      -Automatic friend tagging suggestions.
      -It uses face detection and image recognition to autmatically find the face of the person which 
      matches its' database and hence suggests for us to tag that person based on Deepface.
      -Deep learning is responsible for  recognistion of the faces and identifying which person 
       is in the picture. 
      -It also provides an alternative tag.
      
      
      Transportation and commuting(Uber)
      ----------------------------------------
      -For the case of booking a cab.
      -It  provides  a personalized application which is unique  to you.
      -It automatically detects your locations 
      -It also provide options to either go home  or office or any other frequent place based on your History or pattern.
      -Is uses machin learning algorithms layered on top of
