Machine Learning 
---------------------
-The easy availability of high performance computing(HPC) has resulted in 
 a sudden increase demand for IT professionals having machine learning 
 skills.
 
 Objective of the course
 -------------------------------
 1.What is the crux of machine learning?
 2.What are the different types of machine learning?
 3.What are the different algorithms available for developing machine
  learning models?
 4.What  tools are available for developing these models?
 7.What are the programming choices?
 8.What platform support developement and deployment of machine learning application
 9.What IDES (Integrated developement Evironment) are available.
 10.How to upgrade your skills to this important area.
 
 
 What AI can do
 --------------------
 -Taging a face in a facebook photo.
 -Automous cars running on roads detect object in real time to steer the car.
 -Object detection technic in real time helps to learn the real-time traffic situation and 
 follow the bes path(Google direction)
 -Google translator, helps in communications.
 
 -The advantange of AI is that it can it can perform extremely complex
 jobs with a great accuracy and speed.
 -For example the google direction suggest the fastest path to our destinationat that time instance.
 -It can judge the traffic situation in every possible path to give
  you a travel time estimate for each such path.
 -Alot of AI and machine learning techniques re in-use under the hoods of  google
 direction so that it can cover the entire globe.
