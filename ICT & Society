Introduction to ICT and Society
-----------------------------------
-ICT - infrustracture and component that encompasses computing.
-society - aggrigate of poeple living together. They include learning institutions, Business organisations etc.
-Communication has improved and evolved to facilitate our daily activities.
-In 21 centuary, everything related to communication utilizes technology, to desseminate infomation to a wider range.
-information can be send out in many ways such as:
                            -email
                            -phone call 
                            -televisions
                            -Radios
                            -electronic newspapers
                            
                            
-Information - refers to knowledge obtained from reading, investigating, studying or researching.
-required for decision and predicting the future. ie for the government, they require this information for fair distribution of resources and 
  also be specific on services to offer to specific  citizen.
-Commincation is the act of transmitting messages. It is a process where by information is exchanged between individual using symbols, signs, or verbal interaction.
-Comminication is important in order to gain knowledge. With knowledge we are more confident in expressing our thoughts and ideas.

-Technology -is the use of scientific knowledge, experience and resources to create processes and product that fulfil human needs.
-           -it is fital for communication 
   
   
   evalution of computers 
 --  ------------------------
 -computer generation 
 ---------------------
 first Generation
 -----------------
    - between 1940 - 1956 
    - first generation of computers
    -they were huge slow expensive and often unreliable.
    -in 1954 two Americas by the name Presper  Eckert and William Mauchly build an electronic numeric intergrator computer(<ENIAC)
    -used vacuum tube instead of mechanical switches.
    -In 1941, the two gentlemen build what we call the  UNIVAC which could calculate at the rate of 10000  addition per second
    -There were new technologies development of hardware :
          1. vacuum tube - it was an important advancement of computers, 
                       - it is an electronic tube about the size of light bulb that was used for internal computer component and they were used in thousands.
          2.Punchied Card - used to store data.
          3. magnetic tapes - introduced in 1957
                            -was a faster and more compact method of storing data, and it became more reliable and cost effective.
                          
                          
                          
  The second generation 
  -----------------------------
  -1956 - 1963
  -Transistors - small devices that is used to send electronic signal across resistors.
               -Advanctages:
                          -small than the vacuum tubes.
                          -No warmup time required.
                          -consume less energy.
                          -Generate less heat.
                          -Faster and reliable.
  
  
  
  
  The Third generation 
  ----------------------
  -IBM 370 servers was introduced.
  -silicon chips  were manufactured.
  -An intergrated circuit - is a complete electronic circuit with a small chip of silicon which is used as  a semiconductor.
                          - reduced the cost and size of computers.
  -The magnetic core was replaced by micros..
  -the 256 bit RAM was introduced.
  -silicon chips were reliable and compact and cheap.
  -Hardware and and software were sold seperately therefore software industry was created.
  -the customers service flourished.
 
 
 The Forth Generatation
 -------------------------
-1971 -  
-it took  5 year for the forth generation to grow.
-the growth of computer industry developed.
 -there are many types of computer that developed; e.g ibm, apple.
 -In 1971 intel developed the first microprocessor(Bill Gates)
 -In 1976 Steve Job developed  apple.
 -In 1981 IBM was developped.
 -Hardware technologies such as silcon, microprocessors and storages were developed.

advantages of this generation
--------------------------------------
-Computer became 100 time smaller than the first computer.
-The was an improvement in terms of speed, and storage capacity.
-Personal  computer and software industry grew(boom).
