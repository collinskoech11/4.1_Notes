Introduction to ICT and Society
-----------------------------------
-ICT - infrustrature and component that encompasses computing
-society - aggrigate of poeple living together. they include learning institutions, Business organisations.
-Communication has improved and evolve to facilitate our daily activities.
-The 21 centuary, everything related to communication utilizes technology, to desaminate infomation to a wider a.
information can be send out in many ways such as:
                            -email
                            -phone call 
                            -televisions
                            -Radios
                            -electronic newspapers
                            -
                            
-Information - refers to knowledge obtained from reading, investigating, studying or research.
  require for decision and predict the future. ie for the government, they require this information for fair distribution of resources and 
  also be specific on services to offer to the citizen.
-commincation is the act of transmitting messages . It is a process where by information is exchanged between individual using symbols, signs, or verbal interaction.
-comminication is important in order to gain knowledge. With knowledge we are more confident in expressing our thoughts and ideas.
-
-Technology -is the use of scientific knowledge experience and resources to create processes and product that fulfil human needs.
-           -it is fital for communication 
   
   
   evalution of computers 
 --  ------------------------
 -computer generation 
 ---------------------
 first Generation
 -----------------
    - between 1940 - 1956 
    - first generation of computers
    -they were huge slow expensive and often unreliable.
    -in 194 two Americas by the name Presper  Eckert and Willian Mauchly build an electronic numeric intergrator computer(<ENIAC)
    -used vacuum tube instead of mechanical switches.
    in 1941, the two gentilemen build what we call the uni UNIVAC which could calculate at the rate of 10000  addition per second
    -the were new technologies development of hardware :
           vacuum tube - it was an important advancement of computers, 
                       - it is an electronic tube about the size of light bulb was used for internal computer component and they were used in thousands.
          Punchied Card - used to store data.
          magnetic tapes - introduced in 1957
                          -was a faster and more compact method of storing data, and it became more reliable and cost effective.
                          
                          
                          
  The second generation 
  -----------------------------
  -1956 - 1963
  -Transistors - small devices that is used to send electronic signal across resistors.
               -Advanctages:
                          -small than the vacuum tubes.
                          -No warmup time required
                          -consume less energy
                          -Generate less heat
                          -Faster and reliable
  
  
  
  
  The Third generation 
  ----------------------
  -IBM 370 servers was introduced
  -silicon chips  were manufactured.
  -An intergrated circuit - is a complite electronic circuit with a small chip of silicon which is used as  a semiconductor.
                          - reduced the cost and size of computers.
  -The magnetic core was replaced by micros..
  -the 256 bit ram was introduced
