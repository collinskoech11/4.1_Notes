  Network protocol  and communication overview
  -----------------------------------------------
  -models
  -standards that makes network work
  -How communication occur over network.
  
  
  Elements in communications
  --------------------------
  -message source(sender)
  -destination (receiver)
  -channel(media) - provides pathway over which the message travels.
  
  
  Protocol
  --------------
  -Rules that govern communication 
 
 
 What a protocol must account
 -------------------------------------
 -An identified sender and receiver
 -Common language and grammer.
 -Speed and timing of delivery.
 -confirmation or acknowledgement requirement.
  
  
 -Message encoding - first step of sending message.
                   -process of converting information into another acceptable form
                    for transmission.
 -Decoding - Reversed encoding in order to intercept the information.
 -Encapsulation - placing one message format(letter) inside another message format envelop.
 
 
 Rules of  engagement for message timing
 ----------------------------------------
 -access method
 -flow control
 -Response timeout
 
- Access method - determine when someone is able to send a message.
-Flow control - used to negotiate correct timing for successful correct timing for successful communication.
-Response Timeout - rules that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a responses timeout occur.


Message delivery options
----------------------
-Unicast - is one -to - one delivery option
         - one/single destination for the message
-Multicast - one to many delivery option.
           - a delivery of the same message to a  group of host destination simultanously.
-Broadcast - one to all message delivery option.



Rules that Govern communication
-----------------------------------
-Protocol suite - A group of inter-related protocol necessary to perform a communication.
                - implemented by hosts and networking devices in software.
                
common Networking protocols
-----------------------------
-Hypertext transfer protocol(HTTP)
-Transmission control protocol (TCP)
-Internet protocol (IP
 
 
-IP refers to both ipv4 and ipv6

              HTTP
              -----
-An application protocol.
-Governs the way the way web servers and web client interact.
-Defines the content and formatting  of the requests and responses.
-Implemented by both web server and web client software.


            TCP
            -----
-Transport protocol.
-Devides HTTP.message into segment.
-The segment are

                               Performed by:
                                           Network designers
                                           Engineers
                                           IT administrators
-What is adminstration - Responsibility for keeping an organization's computer network up-to-
                         date and operating intended.

What is  network system and administration?
---------------------------------------
-network system addministration is a branch of engineering that concern the operational management  of human and computer system.
 this engineering is unusual because engineering concept have specific technology solution.
-A system adminstrator work for users so that they can use a system to produce work. therefore a system adminstrator should focus 
 not on the few selfish means but all community(global).
-Once a computing device is attach in the internet, we have to consider the consequences of being directly connected to all other computing device in the world.

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Appying technology in an environment
  ---------------------------------------------
  -A key task in network system adminstration is to build the hardware configaration and the software configuration.
  -Both of this task(h/w, s/w configuration) are performed for users.
  -Each of this task presences its own challenges, howevery, the challanges post by this task can not be delt in issolation.
  -H/w has to conform to the constrains of the physical world.
  -h/w is subjected to power requirement, power challenges, climate and it must have conformance to the basic standards.
  -The type of h/w limite the kind of s/w that run on it.
  -S/w configuration must be carried out on the appropriate h/w.
  -Modern software in the context of global network need to interoperate and survive the possible hostilities of incompatiable and inhospitable competition.
  -In todays equipment , the major challenge is the complexity of multiple software systems, sharing a common internet space.
  -As network system adminstrators, our focus should change from the physical environment to a technological enviromement, this focus must include,
   the diversity of the constant change.
  -Part of the challenges that network adminstrator encounter is to gather for the disperate piece of the community they are serving into a harmonious whole.
  -We apply technology in a particular environment for the purpose which is intented, baring in mind that we provide a support infrustracture.
  -The global view presented to us by information technology  means that we have to think deeply about the system that we employed.
  -The extensive filament of our internetwork system are exposed to .......both accidently and maliciously jack note.
  - N/b  ignoring such pairing will expose the organization into imaginable risk.
  -(Noovel company).

     The human Role in systems
     ----------------------------------
  -For human , the task of system administration is a very careful act,  it requires patience, understanding and experience
  -system administration work is equivalent to people working in the cashualty ward in hospitals.
  -In system adminstration is further challenged that system adminstators work with limited resources,
   unfortunately, system adminstrators must manage the crisis with this limited resources.
  -Because of this challenges, we need to recognise that the answers to them are not alway written for us to copy.
  machines and computers are subject to entropy.
  -Because of this reason, we need to remain calm and attentive and learn new things everyday.
 -Computing system requires the very best of organisation skills and the most professional attitude.
  -As system adminstrators, we need to know the facts that build confidence through experience, however, we
    must also know our limitation in orders to avoid mistake that are provoked easly.
  
  
  Challenges of Network system adminstrators
  -----------------------------------------------
  -Deciding what services are needed.
  -Providing a comfortable enviroment for users.
  -Designing a network which is logical and efficient.
  -Developing ways of fixing errors and problems which occur.
  -Deploying large number of machines which can be easily upgraded later.
  -Keeping track and understanding how to use enormous amount of knowledge which increases every year.
